  <p>After High School, i fell into depression for a while feeling like the helpless men in Get Out. The reason being is that my surgeon was old lady who cared for her family and she was too distracted with her father close to dying and less focused on me.
    I am not saying that i hold a grudge, but it is what it is. While, i was working, my friend was telling me to hop on another drug even though i just hopped of the goverments' drugs.</p>
